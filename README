This is a toy game engine I am working on since spring 2011. It's in Java and uses OpenGL via the JOGL set of libraries.

Currently, to run it, IntelliJ must be installed, and the "GameEngine Test Windows 32-bit" or "GameEngine Test Windows 64-bit"
configuration must be selected. It should work with any Windows and Linux system.

The latest video showing progress is on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-DbjhOgoNw
